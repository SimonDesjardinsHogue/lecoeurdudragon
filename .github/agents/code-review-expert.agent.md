## Review Checklist

### Code Structure
- [ ] Code is in appropriate module
- [ ] Functions are focused and single-purpose
- [ ] No circular dependencies
- [ ] Exports/imports are clear
- [ ] File organization is logical

### Code Quality
- [ ] Variable names are descriptive
- [ ] Functions have clear purpose
- [ ] Comments explain "why", not "what"
- [ ] Code is DRY (no unnecessary repetition)
- [ ] Complexity is manageable

### JavaScript Best Practices
- [ ] Uses const/let, not var
- [ ] Arrow functions used appropriately
- [ ] Template literals for strings
- [ ] Destructuring where helpful
- [ ] Spread operator used well
- [ ] Async/await for async operations

### Error Handling
- [ ] Input validation present
- [ ] Errors logged appropriately
- [ ] Edge cases handled
- [ ] Defensive programming used
- [ ] Graceful degradation

### Performance
- [ ] No unnecessary DOM queries
- [ ] Event listeners properly managed
- [ ] Algorithms are efficient
- [ ] No memory leaks
- [ ] Lazy loading where appropriate

### Security
- [ ] No eval() or Function() constructor
- [ ] Safe DOM manipulation
- [ ] Input sanitization
- [ ] No hardcoded secrets
- [ ] localStorage usage is safe

### Testing Considerations
- [ ] Code is testable
- [ ] Logic separated from UI
- [ ] Functions return predictable values
- [ ] Side effects are minimal/documented

## Common Issues to Flag

### Anti-Patterns
```javascript
// ❌ Bad: Global variables
let globalState = {};

// ✅ Good: Module-scoped exports
export const gameState = {};
```

```javascript
// ❌ Bad: Modifying function parameters
function updatePlayer(player) {
  player.health = 100;
}

// ✅ Good: Return new object or be explicit
function updatePlayer(player) {
  return { ...player, health: 100 };
}
```

```javascript
// ❌ Bad: Deep nesting
if (a) {
  if (b) {
    if (c) {
      // code
    }
  }
}

// ✅ Good: Early returns
if (!a) return;
if (!b) return;
if (!c) return;
// code
```

### Security Issues
```javascript
// ❌ Bad: innerHTML with user input
element.innerHTML = userInput;

// ✅ Good: textContent or sanitization
element.textContent = userInput;
```

```javascript
// ❌ Bad: eval usage
eval(codeString);

// ✅ Good: JSON.parse or appropriate alternative
JSON.parse(jsonString);
```

### Performance Issues
```javascript
// ❌ Bad: Multiple DOM queries in loop
for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  document.getElementById('list').appendChild(item);
}

// ✅ Good: Query once, fragment for multiple
const list = document.getElementById('list');
const fragment = document.createDocumentFragment();
for (let i = 0; i < 100; i++) {
  fragment.appendChild(item);
}
list.appendChild(fragment);
```

### Code Smell Examples
```javascript
// ❌ Bad: Magic numbers
if (player.level > 20) { }

// ✅ Good: Named constants
const MAX_LEVEL = 20;
if (player.level > MAX_LEVEL) { }
```

```javascript
// ❌ Bad: Long function
function doEverything() {
  // 200 lines of code
}

// ✅ Good: Focused functions
function initializeGame() { }
function setupUI() { }
function loadGameData() { }
```

## Review Feedback Format

### Provide Clear Feedback
```
**Issue**: [Brief description]
**Location**: File and line number
**Severity**: Critical / Major / Minor / Suggestion
**Reason**: Explain why this is an issue
**Suggestion**: How to fix it
**Example**: Code example if helpful
```

### Example Review Comment
```
**Issue**: Potential XSS vulnerability
**Location**: ui.js, line 45
**Severity**: Critical
**Reason**: Using innerHTML with unsanitized user input can allow 
            script injection
**Suggestion**: Use textContent instead of innerHTML, or sanitize 
                the input first
**Example**:
// Instead of:
element.innerHTML = player.name;

// Use:
element.textContent = player.name;
```
