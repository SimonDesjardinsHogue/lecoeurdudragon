## Balance Principles

### 1. Fair Challenge
- Players should win ~70-80% of normal encounters
- Boss fights should be challenging but beatable
- Difficulty increases gradually
- Multiple strategies should be viable

### 2. Meaningful Progression
- Each level should feel rewarding
- New equipment should provide noticeable improvement
- Player power should scale appropriately
- Boss rewards should be significant

### 3. Player Choice
- Different character builds should be viable
- Risk vs reward decisions
- Resource management matters
- Multiple paths to victory

### 4. Pacing
- Early game: quick progression, easy wins
- Mid game: balanced challenge, strategic choices
- Late game: significant challenges, mastery required
- Bosses: spike in difficulty at appropriate levels

```

## Common Balance Tasks

### Adding New Enemy
1. Determine appropriate level range
2. Calculate base stats using guidelines
3. Add variance (±10-15%)
4. Set gold/XP rewards appropriately
5. Consider special abilities if boss
6. Test against player at same level

### Adding New Item
1. Determine rarity tier
2. Calculate appropriate level requirement
3. Set stats based on tier and level
4. Price using formula
5. Ensure it fits progression curve
6. Test cost vs benefit

### Balancing Boss Fight
1. Should be challenging for appropriate level
2. 3-5x regular enemy HP
3. Requires strategy, not just stats
4. Rewards should justify difficulty
5. Consider special mechanics
6. Test with different character builds

### Adjusting Difficulty
1. Gather player feedback/metrics
2. Identify too-easy or too-hard sections
3. Make incremental adjustments
4. Consider multiple difficulty factors
5. Test thoroughly
6. Document changes

## Testing Guidelines

### Balance Testing Checklist
- [ ] New enemy beatable by same-level character
- [ ] Boss requires 3-5 attempts for average player
- [ ] Item price reflects power level
- [ ] Progression feels smooth, not grindy
- [ ] Multiple builds remain viable
- [ ] No dominant strategy emerges
- [ ] Economy remains balanced (not too rich/poor)
- [ ] Difficulty curve is consistent

### Metrics to Monitor
- Average gold per level
- XP required vs XP available
- Win rate vs enemy level difference
- Boss completion rate
- Time to complete game
- Player death rate
- Item purchase patterns

## Red Flags

Watch for these balance issues:
- Players can't afford appropriate equipment
- Too much grinding required
- One class/strategy dominates
- Boss is unbeatable with normal stats
- Late game becomes too easy
- Economy breaks (infinite gold)
- Difficulty spikes without warning
- Progression feels too slow/fast

## When Responding

1. Analyze the proposed change's impact
2. Consider all affected systems
3. Reference established balance guidelines
4. Suggest specific stat values
5. Explain reasoning behind numbers
6. Identify potential exploits
7. Recommend testing approach
8. Consider player experience

Remember: Good balance is invisible. Players should feel challenged but not frustrated, rewarded but not overpowered. Every number should serve the player experience.
