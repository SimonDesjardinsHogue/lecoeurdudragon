# Automated Balance Analysis

This document explains the automated balance analysis system for Le Coeur du Dragon.

## Overview

The balance analysis system simulates **30,000 games** (2,500 games per combination of character class and race) with intelligent AI behavior to analyze game balance and provide actionable recommendations for improving character classes and races.

## How It Works

### Test Scope
- **Classes Tested**: Guerrier, Magicien, Archer, Rogue (4 classes)
- **Races Tested**: Humain, Elfe, Nain (3 races)
- **Combinations**: 4 classes × 3 races = 12 combinations
- **Games per Combination**: 2,500
- **Total Simulations**: 30,000 games

### Intelligent AI Behavior

The simulation includes realistic AI that:
1. **Purchases items intelligently**:
   - Prioritizes healing when health is low (< 50%)
   - Buys weapons and armor to improve combat effectiveness
   - Considers class restrictions when purchasing
   - Manages gold economy realistically

2. **Engages in combat**:
   - Fights enemies scaled to player level
   - Faces bosses at appropriate intervals
   - Uses stat modifiers properly
   - Handles win/loss conditions

3. **Manages resources**:
   - Rests when health is critically low
   - Balances spending vs. saving gold
   - Tracks all relevant statistics

### Metrics Tracked

For each game, the system tracks:
- Final level achieved
- Number of kills and deaths
- Combat win/loss ratio
- Bosses defeated
- Gold earned, spent, and remaining
- Items purchased
- Final stats (strength, defense, health, dexterity, constitution)

### Analysis

The system analyzes performance in three ways:

1. **By Class** - Compares the 4 character classes across all races
2. **By Race** - Compares the 3 races across all classes
3. **By Combination** - Analyzes each specific class-race pairing

For each category, it calculates:
- Average performance metrics
- Balance scores (deviation from mean)
- Statistical ranges (min/max)

### Balance Recommendations

The system automatically generates suggestions when:

#### Class Balance Issues
- **Win rate < 90% of average**: Suggests increasing base strength or defense
- **Win rate > 110% of average**: Suggests reducing base strength or max HP
- **Level < 90% of average**: Suggests XP bonuses or reduced XP requirements
- **High death rate**: Suggests increasing HP or defense
- **Poor economy**: Suggests gold rewards increase or item cost reduction

#### Race Balance Issues
- **Win rate < 95% of average**: Suggests adjusting race modifiers
- **Win rate > 105% of average**: Suggests reducing race modifiers
- **Level < 95% of average**: Suggests constitution modifier increase

#### Game-Wide Balance
- **Overall win rate < 60%**: Game too difficult
- **Overall win rate > 85%**: Game too easy

## Running the Analysis

### In the Browser

1. Start the game and navigate to the main menu
2. Look for the "Test d'Équilibre" option
3. Click "Lancer le Test d'Équilibre"
4. Wait for the simulation to complete (may take 1-2 minutes)
5. Review the detailed report with charts and suggestions

### From Command Line

Run the full 30,000 game analysis:

```bash
node run-balance-analysis.js
```

This will:
- Run all 30,000 simulations
- Display results in the terminal
- Save a detailed HTML report with timestamp

For a quick test (1,200 games):

```bash
node run-quick-test.js
```

## Understanding the Results

### Balance Score

Each class and race receives a balance score from 0-100:
- **90-100**: Excellent balance (green)
- **80-90**: Good balance (gold)
- **< 80**: Needs adjustment (red)

The balance score is calculated based on deviation from average in:
- Level progression
- Win rate
- Kill count

### Example Output

```
Class Comparison:
  Guerrier: Level 5.00, WinRate 41.4%, Balance: 99.56/100
  Magicien: Level 5.00, WinRate 41.9%, Balance: 99.70/100
  Archer: Level 5.00, WinRate 41.7%, Balance: 99.99/100
  Rogue: Level 5.00, WinRate 41.8%, Balance: 99.86/100
```

### HTML Report Contents

The generated HTML report includes:
1. **Summary**: Total games, average metrics
2. **Class Comparison Table**: Side-by-side class statistics
3. **Race Comparison Table**: Side-by-side race statistics
4. **Detailed Class Stats**: In-depth metrics for each class
5. **Detailed Race Stats**: In-depth metrics for each race
6. **Suggestions**: Categorized balance recommendations

## Applying Balance Changes

After reviewing the analysis:

1. Review all suggestions in the report
2. Prioritize critical balance issues (balance score < 80)
3. Apply recommended changes to:
   - `js/character-classes.js` for class adjustments
   - `js/character-races.js` for race adjustments
4. Re-run the analysis to verify improvements
5. Iterate until balance scores are > 90

## Technical Details

### Files Modified

- `js/balance-tester.js`: Core simulation and analysis engine
- `js/game-logic.js`: Integration with game UI
- `index.html`: UI for running tests in-browser
- `run-balance-analysis.js`: Command-line test runner

### Performance

- ~100 games/second on typical hardware
- Full 30,000 game analysis: 2-5 minutes
- Quick 1,200 game test: ~10-15 seconds

### Accuracy

With 2,500 games per combination, the statistical confidence is very high. Results are reproducible within ±2% due to randomization in combat and item drops.

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements to the system:
- Parallel processing for faster analysis
- More sophisticated AI strategies (skill usage, special abilities)
- Difficulty level testing
- Boss fight analysis
- Equipment progression tracking
- Time-based progression metrics
